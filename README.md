Hi,I'm Rauan, a Data Scientist who is passionate about making the world a better place with technology and science.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on revenue and churn prediction.
- I am working on Kubernetes auto deployment (ambari and ansible).
- I am looking to collaborate on MLOps software solutions (Feast, Data Ingestion Tools, ML Model registry)
- I am currently learning about cloud-native systems and infrastructure
- Ask me about quantum geometric manifolds and its applications
- Pronous: he/him

Hi,I'm Rauan, a Data Scientist working on revenue and churn prediction.

Currently, I am building the analytical platform to empower my peer data scientists to build, design and implement data analytics and machine learning products built primarily on a kubernetes cluster. 
I regularly share my expertise with my team mates by organizing practical workshops on the Big Data infrastructure (the Apache Stack, Kubernetes, Gitlab CI/CD)
I use TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, HyperOpt, Kubeflow to deliver models and data for high impact business problems.
My team uses a Kubernetes cluster to deploy and orchestrate end-to-end machine learning pipelines.
We are also improving the existing data ingestion tools. Occasionally, we can build a new cluster using ansible and monitor via ambari. 
We love our ML code to be written in Python.


DevOps= Gitlab Runner Pods in Kubernetes
JFrog Container Registry = to store Docker images and ML artefacts
data ingestion = scheduled kubeflow jobs or NiFi/Flink 
ML = TensorFLow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, HyperOpt, XgBoost
cluster_infrastructure = ansible, ambari

**ra312/ra312** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
